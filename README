NOTE: This is experimental stuff. While it will generally work, the purpose
is for experimenting with ideas of how I would like to see a JS framework
operate. Some or all ideas might be bad! Also, things can change quite
dramatically with development.


What is this?

storkCore is a Javascript UI library which attemps a few things:

* To use some form of MVC patterns for the UI components. Cocoa will likely
  be the main influence here.
  
* To not use traditional class-based object oriented programming, but to use
  prototype style OO instead.
  
* Should not require extended backend support or any particular language or
  implementation there (e.g. Ruby). It also should not need to take over the
  complete browser window (unlike Sproutcore).

* Styling of the UI widgets should mostly be left to CSS.

This was developed due to the author being very unsatisfied and uninspired
by the JS UI libraries out there. It seemed there was nothing unique and
imaginative. Many were heavy, trying to solve everything from OO programming
to DOM manipulation and Ajax, or by requiring the coder to support the full
stack used for the framework, from backend upwards.

In comparison storkCore tries to keep things simple and to focus on laying
out a basic framework for UI development, without solving everything at
once, and thus tying the developer to certain solutions.

storkCore has been used for the community-oriented money management service,
Scred.com, in some areas. It was developed for that purpose.
